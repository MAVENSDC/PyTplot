def pwrspc(time, quantity, noline=False, nohanning=False, bin=3, notperhz=False):
    """
    Compute the power spectrum of a given time series.

    Parameters:
        time (array):
            The time array.
        quantity (array):
            The data array for which the power spectrum is to be computed.
            Should be one dimensional and the same length as time.
        noline (bool):
            If True, straight line is not subtracted from the data.
        nohanning (bool):
            If True, no Hanning window is applied to the data.
        bin (int):
            Bin size for binning the data. Default is 3.
        notperhz (bool):
            If True, the output units are the square of the input units.

    Returns:
        tuple: Tuple containing:
            - freq (array):
                The frequency array.
            - power (array):
                The computed power spectrum.

    Notes:
        This is similar to IDL pwrspc.pro routine.

        A Hanning window is applied to the input data, and its power is divided out of the returned spectrum.
        A straight line is subtracted from the data to reduce spurious power due to sawtooth behavior of a background.
        Units are (units)^2 where units are the units of the input quantity. Frequency is in 1/time units.
        Thus, the output represents the mean squared amplitude of the signal at each specific frequency.
        The total (sum) power under the curve is equal to the mean (over time) power of the oscillation in the time domain.
        If the keyword notperhz is True, then power is in units^2. If notperhz is False (default), power is in units^2/Hz.


    Example:
        >>> # Compute the power spectrum of a given time series
        >>> from pytplot import pwrspc
        >>> time = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        >>> quantity = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        >>> freq, power = pwrspc(time, quantity)
